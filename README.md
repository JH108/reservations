# Explanation

This project is largely modeled after the one in the book "Code That Fits in Your Head" by Mark Seemann. 

I have made some changes to the original project but followed the general patterns closely. 

I will be making notations throughout here in the README explaining the patterns I liked and the ones that I found cumbersome.
